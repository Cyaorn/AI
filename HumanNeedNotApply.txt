Human Need Not Apply (AI overtaking humans is going to be bad):

- Physical Labor
	- Baxter
		- customizable to perform a variety of jobs
		- slower, BUT much cheaper than human workers
		- cheap, all-purpose technology tends to sell VERY well
	- robots have already been shown to replace humans
		- cashier robots
		- coffee robots
			- able to take specific orders and specialize based on the customer's preferences
- Horses
	- ideally as technology advances, horses would find some other purpose to fulfill
		- instead horses are almost completely replaced by cars
			- the same idea applies to humans 
- Automobiles
	- Self-driving cars/"Autos"
		- already exist and are capable of driving
		- less imperfect than humans 
			- don't text and drive
			- don't get tired
			- can pay attention almost indefinitely
			- can work in more stressful conditions
				- mines 
		- cheaper than humans
			- truck drivers need to rest during long trips
				- wastes time -> wastes money
			- human accidents cost money
			- insurance companies will almost never need to pay for an auto that, ideally, never crashes
- Future Prospects
	- White collar jobs
		- high demand to replace numerous, more expensive humans
		- software bots are much faster than humans
		- software is capable of learning by itself
			- capable of more complex jobs without having to code a specific algorithm
			- trading bots
				- taught themselves to trade
			- some newspaper articles are written by bots
	- Professional work	
		- Legal work	
			- "Discovery" -> detecting inconsistencies in mounds of paperwork
				- possible to do much more accurately and than humans
					- bots are good at pattern recognition
					- bots don't get tired or make silly mistakes
		- Medicine
			- Watson 
				- able to diagnose based on received input
					- humans are surprisingly inaccurate when it comes to diagnoses
						- about 400,0000 deaths by preventable harm per year
				- able to provide guidance on certain treatments
					- ex: treatments on lung cancer
				- able to memorize the effects of every single drug
				- software is much more accessible than a physical human doctor
			- Research bots
				- able to test many different drugs very quickly
					- more efficient than humans
	- Creative work
		- already limited in scope
			- unreliable to sustain an economy alone
		- humans are not innately creative -> creativity can be replicated
		- Music
			- Emily Howell
				- able to compose music that sounds man-made
		- Chess 
			- Deep Blue vs. Kasparov
				- Human lost to a machine in a complex game
- Top 32 more common jobs by the US Census is capable of being replaced by AI
	- over 45% unemployment rate if it happens
		- worse than the Great Depression
		- very bad for economy

		
The Return of the Machinery Question:
	
- Enlitic's system
	- Radiology
		- Tumors
			- 50% at identifying malignant tumors than humans
			- 0% false negative rate
				- never misdiagnoses a tumor as not there
		- Wrist fractures
			- outperformed humans in identifying wrist fractures 
				- exact statistics unknown
	- shows automation of specialized jobs
- robots only able to overtake routine labor, whether physical or cognitive
	- employment rates in non-routine jobs have been steadily increasing since the 1980's
	- unable to fully replace a radiologist who specializes in many different things
- about 47% of American workers at risk of being replaced by robots
	- mostly in specific areas
		- transport
		- logistics
		- office work
			- receptionists
			- security
		- sales
			- cashiers
			- telemarketers
			- clerks 
	- machine learning allows for all routine jobs to be replaced by the same piece of software
		- not just a single job that people can relocate from
- History shows that technological advances always create more jobs than it destroys
	- increase in demand for tasks not accounted for by what is automated
		- weaving in the Industrial Revolution
			- the process of weaving became automated
				- humans then focused on tending to the machines or operating them
			- merely a shift in the required skill set as opposed to a replacement of the job completely
		- ATMs
			- shifted the jobs of bank tellers from more routine tasks to sales and customer service
	- automation redefines jobs instead of replacing them
	- Legal work
		- automation of Discovery led to a 1.1% increase in demand of legal clerks from 2000-2013
	- e-commerce
		- more accurate recommendations led to an increase in sales
	- technology increases capacity 
		- more space for higher specialization	
	- new jobs are certain to arise with the shift in the standard of technology
		- horses -> cars
			- created jobs in motels and fast-food to serve drivers and motorists
		- newer bots will need people to maintain/train them constantly
- some jobs are impossible for robots to do more efficiently than humans
	- jobs involving empathy or social interaction are better left to humans
		- doctors
		- therapists
		- personal trainers
		- hairdressers
	- drastic increase in "caring" jobs over the last two decades
		- 909% increase in nursing assistants
		- 580% increase in teaching assistants
		- 168% increase in careworkers
- increased automation in jobs increases the value of human-only jobs
- labor is being replaced more by outsourcing cheap labor to developing countries than AI
- no solid evidence that AI has a severe impact on employment
- there is a lot of time between the inception of technology and the implementation of it
